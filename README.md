# 📊 Math Skills

This project is part of the **Zone01Oujda** curriculum. It reads a list of integers from a text file and computes key statistical values:

- **Average**
- **Median**
- **Variance**
- **Standard Deviation**

All outputs are rounded to the nearest integer.

## 🧠 Project Purpose

The objective of this project is to:

- Read data from a `.txt` file.
- Perform basic statistical analysis.
- Structure code using modular Go functions (`mathskills/functions`).
- Handle invalid inputs gracefully.

## 🚀 Usage
  🛠 Run the Program
Use the following command to run the program from your terminal:


go run main.go data.txt
Replace data.txt with the path to your .txt file containing integer values.
